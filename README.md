# linked-list
Like arrays, a Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers. They include a series of connected nodes. Here, each node stores the data and the address of the next node.
# Types of Linked list
Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.
# Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays:
Dynamic Array.

Ease of Insertion/Deletion.

Insertion at the beginning is a constant time operation and takes O(1) time, as compared to arrays where inserting an element at the beginning takes O(n) time,where n is the number of elements in the array.

# Representation of Singly Linked Lists:
A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head of the linked list. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points to NULL.

Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:

A Data Item (we can store integers, strings, or any type of data).

Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or An address of another node

# Applications of Linked Lists
● Linked Lists can be used to implement useful data structures like stacks and queues.

● Linked Lists can be used to implement hash tables, each bucket of the hash table can be a linked list.

● Linked Lists can be used to implement graphs (Adjacency List representation of graph).

● Linked Lists can be used in a refined way in implementing different file systems in one form or another.
